# SQL Aggregation Practice

This project includes a set of SQL exercises built around real-world data analysis scenarios, with a focus on aggregation queries.

The tasks are designed to help understand how to:
- Summarize data using COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX
- Group results and filter them using GROUP BY and HAVING
- Work with datasets like a movie streaming platform to extract meaningful insights

## Whatâ€™s Inside

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Movie_Streaming_Analytics_Tasks.sql` | A collection of queries for analyzing streaming data using aggregate functions |
| `SQL_Query_Analysis_Task.docx` | Written answers to some of the SQL tasks with explanations |
| `TASK9_AGGREGATIONS.sql` | Aggregation-based queries written for a custom database we used in class |

## How to Run the Queries

1. Open any of the `.sql` files in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
2. Use your own test database or recreate the one we worked with, based on the queries.
3. Run the scripts and review the results.
4. You can also check the `.docx` file for explanations and written answers to the last few tasks.

## Why I Made This

I created this repository while practicing SQL aggregation in class. It helped me better understand how to extract insights from data, and I'm sharing it here for anyone who wants to practice the same.

This is useful if you're:
- Learning SQL and want to try hands-on examples
- Preparing for SQL interviews
- Practicing how to work with real analysis scenarios
